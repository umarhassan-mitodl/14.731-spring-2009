Research Proposal
-----------------

Research proposals should discuss the question, the data, and the methodology. The question may come from your own research (pared down to meet the constraints of the course), the readings, or current events. The data section should list data needed to answer your question. The methodology section explains calculations and analyses you will do on the data to reach a conclusion. The two proposals may be but do not have to be thematically related. You should write 3-5 double-spaced pages.

Oral Presentation
-----------------

The oral presentation should be 10-15 minutes long. It should present your proposal and its components. After the presentation, the class should understand what question you hope to answer, the data needed to answer it, and how you plan to analyze that data. Preliminary findings are encouraged but not required.
